# hello world

初めまして、皆さん。hotelと申します。よろしく！

hello, i go by hotel (or hotelcalifornia) on the internet. i'm a software engineer with time to kill who happens to be decent
at japanese. a friend has urged me to start translating the re:zero web novel starting from arc 5. i don't really know the
whole situation, but i guess there's been a lack of quality translation recently. so i guess i'll do my best!

i can't promise it'll be great, but i think i can at least beat machine translation. also don't expect updates to come at any
reasonable intervals just yet. maybe once i get a routine going i'll be able to change that, but for the time being i have a
bunch of other projects that demand my attention, so i'll translate as and when i can.

if you're cool with that, stick around and i think we'll have a good time :^)
