kicking against the beaten earth, his body springs forward. as the wind hits the
sweat dripping down his brow, he blinks it away from the corner of his eye.
while feeling the pain of sucking oxygen into his lungs, his body is beginning
to tighten around his core.

"hng!" gritting his teeth, he forces the pain away. in his mind he pictures just
one thing---the word "goal."

"---!" from far away, he feels as though he can hear someone's raised voice.
steadily getting closer, trying to chase subaru down. relying on that voice,
as if pulling on a rope, forward, forward---

"---!" an eager voice calls out to him as he runs, paying no heed to his whited
out vision. before long---

"it's a 'goal!'"

he steps over the awkward, white line spread out at his feet, and in that moment
heaven and earth were reversed.

crashing headfirst into some short weeds, subaru instantly puts both hands on
the ground and turns forward. suppressing the crash with a movement he's well-
accustomed to, he adds two extra rotations and throws himself on the ground,
spread-eagle.

"bwah! ah! painful! difficult! but it's over! i finished!" he cries out in a
desparate voice, breathing heavily.

this seemingly abusive declaration is made to cheer up the spirit of one on the
verge of wilting. "you must not think of that tired feeling as fatigue, nor of
that effort as hardship."
