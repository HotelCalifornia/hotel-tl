suddenly, when returning home from the convenience store, hikikomori and student
nagatsuki subaru is summoned to another world. lacking knowledge, technology,
military prowess, and communication skills, this average joe with absolutely
nothing to his name is thrown into a parallel world without so much as a cheat
bonus and has to fight desparately to survive. the only blessing he was granted
is called "return by death"---the ability to "return from death" with only his
regrets! in this new world with nothing to rely on, just how many times will he
die? and what will he gain?
